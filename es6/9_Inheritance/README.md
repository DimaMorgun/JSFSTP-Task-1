With most of the gory details of <abbr title="Object-Oriented JavaScript">OOJS</abbr> now explained, this article shows how to create "child" object classes (constructors) that inherit features from their "parent" classes. In addition, we present some advice on when and where you might use <abbr title="Object-Oriented JavaScript">OOJS</abbr>, and look at how classes are dealt with in modern ECMAScript syntax.
