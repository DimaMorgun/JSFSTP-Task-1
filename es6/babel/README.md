## What is Babel?

### Babel is a JavaScript compiler

Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

### ES2015 and beyond
Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers.

These [plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins "plugins") allow you to use new syntax, right now without waiting for browser support. Check out our [usage guide](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/usage "usage guide") to get started.

### JSX and React
Babel can convert JSX syntax! Check out our React preset to get started. Use it together with the babel-sublime package to bring syntax highlighting to a whole new level.

### Install guide commands for this sample
- (init package json) npm init
- (install babel dependencies with dev flag) npm i babel-cli babel-core babel-preset-env --save-dev
